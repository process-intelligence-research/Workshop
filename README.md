## Run code online

You can also run the code online via Google's [Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/). 
Colab allows users with Google accounts to execute Jupyter notebooks on the Google cloud. 

**To execute the notebook in Colab:**
1. Click the `Open in Colab` button above. It will launch the notebook directly.
2. Make the notebook live by clicking 'Connect' in the Colab toolbar. 
3. Select `Runtime > Run All` in the menu to execute the notebook. (You may get a warning that the page was not authored by Google.)
